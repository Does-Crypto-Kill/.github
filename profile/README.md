# Are the Cytocurrencies polluting the enviornment by using carbon rich fuel sources

Cryptocurrencies and NFT have been known to create a large carbon footprint based on their algorithmic complexity and 
decentralized system design for proof of work and mining. We provide a machine learning framework to digest the bitcoin 
transactions and correlate them with gridâ€™s electricity generation patterns to estimate and analyse their carbon cost.
